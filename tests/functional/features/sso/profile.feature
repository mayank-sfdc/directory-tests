  Scenario: Suppliers should not be able to register with the same email again
    # No error should be displayed when Supplier attempts to register with an
    # existing email address (intended behaviour) yet no verification email
    # should be sent. Moreover there's no point in checking in DB whether
    # there's only 1 account with the same email address as there's `unique`
    # constraint configured on the `email` column.
